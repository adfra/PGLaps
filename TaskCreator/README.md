# PGLaps - Task Creator

This little command line tool is used to create a task file for the XCTrack program in .xctsk format. The usage is quite simple.
To run, PLS download the .exe and execute. A CMD window pops up requesting the necessary inputs to create a file with the relocated and transposed task.
