# TaskTransposer

This little tool takes an .xctsk file and repositions the task to a chosen set of Google coordinates along with adjusting the task rotation based on the bearing of the first leg of the task. 

To run, PLS download the .exe and execute. A CMD window pops up requesting the necessary inputs to create a file with the relocated and transposed task.
